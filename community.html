                  The fun continues for residents of Churchill Meadows when you consider how easily you can get to the
                  Toronto Premium Outlets, located in neighboring Milton. Residents can take Ninth Line directly to
                  Steeles or opt for the more scenic ride along Derry to Trafalgar in order to arrive at the Premium
                  Outlet Centre. Opening in 2013 Toronto Premium Outlets is the first of its kind in Canada, boasting
                  400,000 square
                  feet of shopping including the first ever Hudson's Bay Discount Store, which was recently replaced by
                  Saks Fifth Avenue. The popularity of the outlet style shopping & many designer stores has increased
                  year after year, proof of that is in the recent construction of a 5-storey parking facility to
                  accommodate all travelers to the shopping centre. Being situated in a more remote, commercial area,
                  residents of Churchill Meadows have the easiest and most direct access to the outlets of anyone in
                  Mississauga. Outdoor food trucks, events, and great bargains put on at the Outlets are just more
                  reasons to buy
                  Churchill Meadows real estate.
